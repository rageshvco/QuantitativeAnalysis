# QuantitativeAnalysis

Quantitative Simulation performs risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values—called a probability distribution—for any factor that has inherent uncertainty. It then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the input probability distributions. Depending upon the number of uncertainties and the ranges specified for them, simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations before it is complete. The result of a simulation is a range – or distribution – of possible outcome values. This data on possible results enables you to calculate the probabilities of different outcomes in your forecasts, as well as perform a wide range of additional analysis.


- This Quantiative Analysis will expalin the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction of forcasting models. 
- This simulation is assign the multiple vlaues to an uncertain events to acheieve multiple results. Once the results are available, it will take the average of the results to get the estimate.
